Character animations
- The character animation format will look something like this JSON:

{
    frames: [
        {
            index: image_id, // image id as given in next section
            x: x_offset, // sprite position relative to player coords
            y: y_offset, // sprite position relative to player coords
            delay: frame_delay // wait this long until next frame
        }
    ],
    sprites: [
        {
            id: image_id,
            x: x_offset,
            y: y_offset,
            width: width,
            height: height
        }
    ]
}

  We need to figure out what sprite sheets we're using and then
  I'll try and build some idle/walking animations in this format.
